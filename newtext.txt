I am realy happy. So, I went to bar to have a drink with my friends. But my friends abandon me in the middle of somewhere accross the road along aiporta runway on the very side. I was youngest amoung all of my friends. With few acuracy and very few chance of getting home, I finally decided to  addopt a situation of hiking a car to get to home.From that I hvae learned a greatest moral in  my life.
